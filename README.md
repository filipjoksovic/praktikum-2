# praktikum-2

Repository for the Second Praktikum for FERI, containing the Shopping list application

# Repo structure

For easier mantainability, a monorepo is used, which will store all necessary services and resources for running the application(s).

Each service or resource is contained in its separate folder, which will contain a separate README.md file that contains the installation, environment setup and running instructions.
